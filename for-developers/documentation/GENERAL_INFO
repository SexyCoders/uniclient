# Our Documentation Philosophy

Here at SexyCoders we are big linux lovers, and thus always try to stay as 
close to it as possible!

Thus all our documentation is in plaintext and can be easilly read using 
your favourite editor (we know its vim dont worry)!!!

That being said, since we are living in an increaasingly visual and online 
world we have to adapt and overcome. So we have created a dynamic and 
versatile system that compiles the plaintext files into formatted html - 
for your own usage - and for upload to our website.

## Logic

We have to be able to keep the file readable in plaintext and at the same 
time have a way to parse the file and place the correct paragraphs and 
graphics in the correct place.

Thus we use the '#' symbol as our 'command char' since it doesnt obscure 
the viewing of the file in text.

Special graphics are notated by enclosing them in #'s for example 
'#AUTHOR#' or '#NOTE#'.

Titles are notated using a # in the beginning of the line. The number of # 
denotes the size of the title - '#'='<h1>' '##'='<h2>' etc.

The rest is place inside '<p>' tags before the final file is asssebled 
based on the template.

To understand and/or work on the compiler please read the compiler 
documentation (COMPILER file) or visit the corresponding page in our 
online docs.
