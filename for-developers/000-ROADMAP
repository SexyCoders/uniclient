# contribution roadmap for uniclient platform

## Our Logic

The main logic behind uniclient is modularity and customization, combined 
with a webbased interface that allows it to be used anytime, anywhere.

Thus, all our services are designed as modules, using their own docker 
containers, resources, databases etc.

Networking is done using docker-compose and docker virtual networking - 
within a swarm -  and all ips are dynamic.

## Guidelines

Every module is expected to have minimal functionallity at the best 
possible performance. Thus you are expected to use bleeding-edge 
technologies, like nodejs, redis etc to make your module fast and easily 
maintainable.

Compiled languages, like C or C++ are also encouraged in case of power 
hungry tasks. 

You are also encouraged to use parallel processing if applicable, but 
please keep in mind that everything will run indide docker containers, and 
weigh that against possible multithreading/multiprocessing.

You should try to make your implementation use as few docker containers as 
possible, without sacrificing any modularity! For example if you have a 
redis or mongo running, use it for as many databases, and as often as you 
can untill it starts affecting the performance of the module. 

DONT CLUTTER THE STACK! 
Swarm stabillity is of the utmost importance to us!

Dont overload your module! If you wish you can create multiple, but each 
module should be doing ONE and ONLY ONE thing! 

That being said please also dont seperate modules just for the sakes of 
sepperation since that will lead to a debug hell for both us and you!

Finally your docker images (that you will define using 'Dockefiles' and a 
'docker-compose.yml' file) have to be:
- based on debian 11
- dynamic -> no static ip access or port mapping!
- minimal -> please create as few layers as possible, avoid COPY and RUN 
commands and use CMD instead!

#ATTENTION#

All your data (configutation, temp, config etc) should be stored under ONE 
directory located at or under '/data/community/<your-module-name>'

This is for your information since your module will end up there in our 
production system! This may or may not be an issue for you but please keep 
it in mind!

Please also use good names to avoid conflicts! We will be checking 
ourselves, but it will be a shame for you to have to change multiple 
instances of a name!

Public name of the module has nothing to do with this and will be 
determined later!

Finally, if you wish to work on a module, reach out to team@sexycoders.org 
explaining roughly what it will be, so we can register it in our mailing 
list and update you for any changes made to the specifications/requirements 
or any other changes that might affect you!

Have fun coding,
Shane from Greece
