# Communication between endpoints:

To establish communication between the various modules, endpoints and user 
interfaces of our application, we have declared and are using a very strict 
Segment.

This segment is used in all communications with very little variation and 
should always be regarded as valid unless specified otherwise.

The segment consists of the following (mandatory) fields, but can and is 
amended for each communication to meed its needs. For specifics please 
lookup the corresponding module documentation.

## Segment:

- token -> oauth2 token for verification - if this is missing the message 
is automatically and immediatelly dropped in all endpoints
- data -> application level data, managed and set by user - this is 
expected to be one of the following
	- binary data such as base64 encoded strings
	- json object
    Since it is implemented on application level, the developer is 
responsible for the parsing of the data, hence the format can be pretty 
much anything, BUT for maintenance purposes PLEASE use one of the above!

#NOTE#
The whole segment will be base64 encoded, so you will NOT have to worry 
about being URL/binary safe!
